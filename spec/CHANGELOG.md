# Changelog

## 1.0.0 (April 17, 2019)

Fluent Syntax 1.0 is out! ðŸŽ‰ With this release, we commit to no braking
changes to the syntax and to the AST during the 1.x lifetime. The formal
definition of the grammar can be found in the `spec/` directory, together
with documents outlining good practices, validation rules, and the
compatibility strategy for future releases.

  - There are no grammar changes compared to version 0.9 of the specification.

    Version 0.9 served as the release candidate for 1.0. The grammar and the
    AST of Syntax 1.0 are identical to Syntax 0.9.

  - Added the compatibility strategy document. (#251)

    The goal of this document is to define the strategy for introducing and
    deprecating syntax features after 1.0.

## 0.9.0 (March 26, 2019)

  - Flatten complex reference expressions. (#221)

    Reference expressions which may take complex forms, such as a reference
    to a message's attribute, or a parameterized reference to an attribute of
    a term, are now stored in a simplified manner. Instead of nesting
    multiple expression nodes (e.g. `CallExpression` of an
    `AttributeExpression` of a `TermReference`), all information is available
    directly in the reference expression.

    This change affects the following AST nodes:

    -  `MessageReference` now has an optional `attribute` field,
    - `FunctionReference` now has a required `arguments` field,
    - `TermReference` now has an optional `attribute` field and an optional
      `arguments` field.

  - Remove `VariantLists`. (#204)

    The `VariantLists` and the `VariantExpression` syntax and AST nodes were
    deprecated in Syntax 0.9 and have now been removed.

  - Rename `StringLiteral.raw` to `value`. (#243)

    `StringLiteral.value` contains the exact contents of the string literal,
    character-for-character. Escape sequences are stored verbatim without
    processing.

    Implementations may decide how to process the raw value. When they do,
    however, they must comply with the behavior specified in `Literal.parse`.

  - Rename `args` to `arguments`.

    The `args` field of `MessageReference`, `TermReference`,
    `FunctionReference`, and `Annotation` has been renamed to `arguments`.

## 0.8.0 (December 13, 2018)

  - Preserve content-indent in multiline `Patterns`. (#162)

    Multiline `Patterns` require to be indented by at least one space. In
    Syntax 0.7 all leading ident of every line was stripped. In Syntax 0.8
    only the maximum indent common to all indented lines is removed. This
    behavior works for all `Patterns`: in `Messages`, `Terms`, `Attributes`
    and `Variants`.

    ```properties
    multiline1 =
        This message has two spaces of indent
          on the second line of its value.
    ```

    This behavior also works when the first line of a block `Pattern` is
    indented relative to the following lines:

    ```properties
    multiline2 =
          This message has two spaces of indent
        on the first line of its value.
    ```

    Note that only indented lines participate in this behavior. Specifically,
    if a `Pattern` starts on the same line as the message identifier, then
    it's not considered as indented, and is excluded from the indent
    stripping.

    ```properties
    multiline3 = This message has two spaces of indent
          on the second line of its value. The first
        line is not considered indented at all.
    ```

    If a `Pattern` starts on the same line as the identifier, its first line
    is subject to the leading-whitespace stripping which is applied to all
    `Patterns`.

    ```properties
    # Same value as multiline3 above.
    multiline4 =     This message has two spaces of indent
          on the second line of its value. The first
        line is not considered indented at all.
    ```

    Note that if a multiline `Pattern` starts on the same line as the
    identifier and it only consists of one more line of text below it, then
    the maximum indent common to all _indented_ lines is equal to the indent
    of the second line, i.e. the only indented line. All indent will be
    removed in this case. `{" "}` can be used to preserve it explicitly.

    ```properties
    multiline5 = This message has no indent
            on the second line of its value.
    ```

  - Deprecate `VariantLists`. (#204)

    `VariantLists` and `VariantExpression` have been deprecated. They will be
    removed before Fluent 1.0 is released. Please use parameterized `Terms`
    instead (see below). Furthermore, in Syntax 0.8 it's not possible to nest
    `VaraintLists` anymore (#220).

  - Introduce parameterized `Terms`. (#176, #212)

    References to `Terms` can now receive parameters which will be used by
    the runtime as values of variables referenced from within the `Term`.
    This allows `Terms` to use regular `Patterns` as values, rather than
    `VariantLists`:

    ```properties
    # BEFORE A Term with a VariantList as a value.
    -thing = {
       *[definite] the thing
        [indefinite] a thing
    }

    this = This is { -term[indefinite] }.
    ```

    ```properties
    # AFTER A parameterized Term with a Pattern as a value.
    -thing = { $article ->
       *[definite] the thing
        [indefinite] a thing
    }

    this = This is { -thing(article: "indefinite") }.
    ```

    Since `Patterns` can be nested, this feature allows more complex
    hierarchies of term values:

    ```properties
    # AFTER A parameterized Term with nested Patterns.
    -thing = { $article ->
       *[definite] { $first-letter ->
           *[lower] the thing
            [upper] The thing
        }
        [indefinite] { $first-letter ->
           *[lower] a thing
            [upper] A thing
        }
    }

    this = This is { -term(first-letter: "lower", article: "indefinite") }.
    ```

    Parameters must be named; positional parameters are ignored. If a
    parameter is omitted then the regular default variant logic applies. The
    above example could thus be written as `{-term(article: "indefinite")}`
    and the `lower` variant would be used because it is marked as the default
    one. If no parameters are specified, the paranthesis can be omitted:
    `{-term()}` and `{-term}` are functionally the same.

    Term attributes can be parameterized as well. To access them, use the
    `-term.attr(param: "value")` syntax.

  - Support all Unicode characters in values. ðŸŽ‰ (#174, #207)

    All Unicode characters can now be used in values of `TextElements` and
    `StringLiterals`, except those recognized as special by the syntax. Refer
    to `spec/recommendations.md` for information about character ranges which
    translation authors are encouraged to avoid.

  - Don't store the `-` sigil in `Identifiers` of `Terms`. (#142)

    The `-` sigil is no longer part of the term's `Identifier`. This is now
    consistent with how `Identifiers` of variables don't include the `$`
    sigil either.

  - Treat backslash (`\`) as a regular character in `TextElements`. (#123)

    Backslash does no longer have special escaping powers when used in
    `TextElements`. It's still recognized as special in `StringLiterals`,
    however. `StringLiterals` can be used to insert all special-purpose
    characters in text. For instance, `{"{"}` will insert the literal opening
    curly brace (`{`), `{"\u00A0"}` will insert the non-breaking space, and
    `{"   "}` can be used to make a translation start or end with whitespace,
    which would otherwise by trimmed by `Pattern.`

  - Forbid closing brace in `TextElements`. (#186)

    Both the opening and the closing brace are now considered special when
    present in `TextElements`. `{"}"}` can be used to insert a literal
    closing brace.

  - Store both the raw and the unescaped value in `StringLiteral`. (#203)

    `StringLiteral.value` has been change to store the unescaped ("cooked")
    value of the string literal: all known escape sequences are replaced with
    the characters they represent. `StringLiteral.raw` has been added and
    stores the raw value as it was typed by the author of the string literal:
    escapes sequences are not processed in any way.

  - Add the `\UHHHHHH` escape sequence. (#201)

    In addition to the already-supported `\uHHHH` escape sequence, `\UHHHHHH`
    is now also recognized and can be used to encode Unicode codepoints in the
    U+010000 to U+10FFFF range. For example, `{"\U01F602"}` can be used to
    represent ðŸ˜‚.

  - Don't normalize line endings in `Junk`. (#184)

    Junk represents a literal slice of unparsed content and shouldn't have
    its line endings normalized to LF.

  - Add the `FunctionReference` production. (#210)

    Function references in `CallExpressions` are now stored as
    `FunctionReference` AST nodes, with an `id` field which is an
    `Identifier`.

    The `Function` production and its corresponding AST node have been
    removed. The logic validating that function names are all upper-case has
    been moved to `abstract.js`.

## 0.7.0 (October 15, 2018)

  - Relax the indentation requirement. (#87)

    Attributes, variant keys and placeables may now be written without
    indent, including the closing curly brace, `}`.

        emails = { $unreadEmails ->
            [one] You have one unread email.
           *[other] You have { $unreadEmails } unread emails.
        }

    Multiline `TextElements` still require indent to aid error recovery.

        multiline-text =
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,
            sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore
            magna aliqua.


  - Forbid tab as syntax whitespace. (#165)

    Tabs are now parsed as part of `TextElement`'s value and are not allowed
    outside of them.

  - Remove support for CR as a line ending. (#154)

    Valid line endings for Fluent files are: LF (U+0A) and CRLF (U+0D U+0A).

  - Normalize all EOLs as LF. (#163)

    The AST now stores line endings using the line feed character (LF, U+0A),
    even if the input file used CRLF or a mix of CRLF and LF.

  - Restrict `VariantKey` to `NumberLiteral` and `Identifier`. (#127)

    The `VariantName` AST node has been removed

## 0.6.0 (July 24, 2018)

  - Created the reference parser for Fluent Syntax.

    This version is the first to ship with the official reference
    implementation of the parser. The parser focuses on strictness and
    correctness at a cost of reduced performance.

    The ASDL description of the AST has been removed in favor of
    `syntax/ast.js` which defines the actual AST nodes returned by the
    reference parser.

    The EBNF is now auto-generated from the reference parser's
    `syntax/grammar.js` file. It provides an easy to read overview of the
    grammar and will continue to be updated in the future.

    Going forward, all changes to the grammar will be implemented in the
    reference parser first, which also ships with an extensive test suite.

  - Added junk entries.

    The grammar now explicitly defines the `junk_line` production which is
    converted into `Junk` during the AST construction.

  - Comments may now be attached to Messages or Terms.

    The grammar now encodes the behavior for Comments preceding Messages and
    Terms. If there are no blank lines between the Comment and the Message or
    the Term, the Comment becomes part of the `Message` or the `Term` AST node.

  - Fixed many issues with the white-space grammar.

    The EBNF for Syntax 0.5 had many issues with its use of `inline-space` and
    `break-indent`. It defined undesirable or impossible parsing behavior.
    These issues have been fixed and the new test suite will help ensure the
    correctness of the grammar in the future.

  - Named arguments to `CallExpressions` must now follow all positional ones.

    The order of arguments to `CallExpressions` is now strictly defined as
    positional first, named second. The `CallExpression`'s `arguments` field
    was replaced by two new fields: `positional` and `named`.

  - Named arguments to `CallExpressions` must now be unique.

  - Added the `TermReference` expression.

    References to terms used to be stored as `MessageReferences` in the AST.
    They now have their own expression type.

  - Store the referent expression in attribute and variant expressions.

    `MessageAttributeExpression`, `TermAttributeExpression` and
    `TermVariantExpression` now store the entire referent expression in a new
    `ref` field, rather than just the `Identifier`.

  - `ExternalArgument` is now called `VariableReference`.

  - Add the `VariantList` value type.

    Selector-less `SelectExpressions` have been removed in favor of
    `VariantLists` which share the same syntax but have more restricted usage.
    Values of `Messages` and all `Attributes` may only be `Patterns`.  Values
    of `Terms` may either be `Patterns` or `VariantLists`.  Values of
    `Variants` may only be `VariantLists` if they're defined in another
    `VariantList`.

  - `StringExpression` is now called `StringLiteral`.

  - `NumberExpression` is now called `NumberLiteral`.

  - `TextElement` and `Placeable` are now subclasses of an abstract
    `PatternElement` class.


## 0.5.0 (January 31, 2018)

  - Added terms. (#62, #85)

    Terms are entries which can only be referenced by other messages. Terms
    cannot be retrieved by the `MessageContext` runtime.

    Terms start their identifiers with a single dash `-`. Tools may introduce
    different checks for messages and terms.

  - Removed tags. (#67)

    The same functionality can be achieved by using term attributes.

    ```properties
    -brand-name = Firefox
        .gender = masculine

    has-updated =
        { -brand-name.gender ->
            [masculine] { -brand-name} zostaÅ‚ zaktualizowany.
            [feminine] { -brand-name } zostaÅ‚a zaktualizowana.
           *[other] Program { -brand-name } zostaÅ‚ zaktualizowany.
        }
    ```

  - Changed the comment sigil to `#`. (#58)

  - Removed sections and introduced group and resource comments. (#58)

    Comments starting with `##` and `###` define the outline of the file and
    replace sections. `##` denotes group-level comments (`GroupComment` in
    ASDL) and `###` denotes resource-level comments (`ResourceComment`).
    These are always standalone `Comment` entries.

    The `comment` field on the `Resource` node was removed.

  - Require `=` after the identifier in message definitions. (#63)

  - Renamed `Symbol` to `VariantName` in the ASDL.

## 0.4.0 (November 14, 2017)

  - Added the `Placeable` production as a wrapper for expressions in patterns.

    This allows storing more precise information about the whitespace around
    the placeable's braces.

  - Separated the `expr` type into `inline_expr` and `block_expr`.

    This mirrors the EBNF, where a select expression cannot by an argument to
    a call expression nor selector of another select expression without being
    wrapped in braces.

  - The dash `-` is not allowed at the beginning of identifiers.

    There's an ongoing discussion in #62 about using the leading `-` for
    private messages (terms) in the future.

  - The question mark `?` is not allowed in identifiers.

    We want to start with a more strict syntax for identifiers. See the
    discussion in #65.

  - Small EBNF fixes:

    - Allowed multiline comments.
    - Allowed inline space in blank lines between entries.

## 0.3.0

  - Added tags for language-specific grammatical information.

    Tags are binary values attached to messages.  They are language-specific and
    can be used to describe grammatical characteristics of the message.

        brand-name = Firefox
            #masculine

        brand-name = Aurora
            #feminine
            #vowel

    Tags can be used in select expressions by matching a hashtag name to the
    message:

        has-updated = { brand-name ->
                [masculine] â€¦
                [feminine] â€¦
               *[other] â€¦
            }

    Tags can only be defined on messages which have a value and don't have any
    attributes.

  - The message body must be indented now.

    Quoted strings are now only valid in placeables and cannot contain other
    placeables.  Removed `|` for multiline blocks.

  - Added `TextElement` production for text elements of the `Pattern`.

  - Added `annotations` and `span` to all `entry` types.

    Spans are `{ start, end }` productions. Annotations are `{ code, args,
    message, span }` productions.

  - Allowed more characters in keys.

    Variant keys are now trimmed from both sides.

    Introduced `word` which replaces `keyword` and changes its semantics:
    `words` cannot contain spaces.  Space-separated sequences of `words` are
    called `symbols`.

    `variant-key` may now be a `number` or a `symbol`.

    `Keyword` is now called `Symbol` in ASDL.

  - Defined the behavior of backslash escapes as follows:

    - Escape sequences are only allowed in `text` and `quoted-text`.

    - Newlines are preserved by the parser. This allows proper serialization.

    - Known escape sequences are: `\\` for the literal backslash, `\"` for the
      literal double quote, `\{` for the literal opening brace and `\u`
      followed by 4 hex digits for Unicode code points. Representing code
      points from outside of the Basic Multilingual Plane is made possible with
      surrogate pairs (two `\uXXXX` sequences). Using the actual character is
      encouraged, however.

    - Any other escaped characters result in a parsing error.

  - Changed the sigil for comments to `//`.
  - Renamed `SelectExpression`'s `expr` field to `expression`.
  - Renamed `Junk`'s and `Comment`s `body` fields to `content`.
  - Renamed `CallExpression`'s `args` field to `arguments`.
  - Renamed `NamedArgument`'s `val` field to `value`.
  - Renamed `keyword-argument` to `named-argument`
  - Removed the list data type

    Removed `LIST`, `LEN`, `TAKE`, `DROP`.

## 0.2.0

  - (9453242, 1d55148) Simplify Expressions

    ASDL's `elem` and `expr` types were merged into a single `expr` type.
    `Pattern` is now now part of `expr`.

    `KeyValueArgument` is no longer an `Expression` and is now called
    `NamedArgument`.

    `CallExpression's callee is now a new type: `fun`.

    EBNF's `variable` is now called `external`.

  - (fbcdc07) Fix #10. Remove Section's body

    The list of entries in `Resource.body` is now guaranteed to be flat.

  - (7120a0d) Remove dot as a valid character in builtin names
  - (78ceed8) Fix #6. New syntax for attributes

    Replace traits which used the `[key] value` syntax with `attributes`:

        foo
            .attr = An attribute

  - (a183bef) Fix #5. Allow select-expression with an empty selector
  - (26ec797) Fix #3. Use { and } for explicit grouping
  - (402cc2b) Fix #8. Forbid patterns as values of `name-arguments`.
  - (a5811e1) Fix #2. Disallow multiple expressions in a placeable.
  - (35d6ebe) Fix #1. Require one variant to be default.
  - (104e11b) Use `:` between the name and the value of a `named-argument`.
  - (ab27e60) Use W3C's EBNF

## 0.1.0

  - (be77dbb) Add ASDL description of the Fluent syntax.

    This is the intial release corresponding to FTL as implemented in `l20n.js`
    as of January 2017 and in the JavaScript implementation of Project Fluent:
    `fluent@0.1.0`.
