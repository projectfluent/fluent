# Fluent

Fluent is a localization system designed to unleash the expressive power of
the natural language.

This repository contains the specification, the reference implementation of the
parser and the documentation for Fluent.

## Fluent Syntax (FTL)

FTL is the syntax for describing translation resources in Project Fluent.  FTL
stands for *Fluent Translation List*. Read the [Fluent Syntax Guide][] to get
started learning Fluent.

The `syntax/` directory contains the reference implementation of the syntax as
a _LL(infinity)_ parser.

The `spec/` directory contains the formal EBNF grammar, autogenerated from the
reference implementation.

## Development

While working on the reference parser, use the following commands to test and
validate your work:

    npm test                # Test the parser against JSON AST fixtures.
    npm run lint            # Lint the parser code.

    npm run build:ebnf      # Generate the EBNF from syntax/grammar.mjs.
    npm run build:fixtures  # Generate test fixtures (FTL â†’ JSON AST).
    npm run build:guide     # Build the HTML version of the Guide.

    npm run bench           # Run the performance benchmark on large FTL.
