# Private Messages

Private messages are similar to regular messages but they can only be used as
references in other messages. Their identifiers start with at least one dash
`-` like in the example above: `-brand-name`. The runtime cannot retrieve
private messages directly. They are best used to define terms which can be
used consistently across the localization of the entire product.

```
-brand-name = Firefox

app-title = { -brand-name }
has-updated = { -brand-name } has been updated.
```

## Private Messages and Variants

Values of private messages may have mulitple [variants](variants.html),
including the default variant marked with an asterisk (`*`). For instance,
variants may correspond to different grammatical cases.

```
-brand-name =
    {
       *[nominative] Firefox
        [accusative] Firefoxa
    }

app-title = { -brand-name }
restart-app = Zrestartuj { -brand-name[accusative] }.
```

Use variants to define different _facets_ of the message's value. Variants
are essentially the same value, just in slightly different forms to make it
grammatically correct when used inside of other messages.

## Private Messages and Attributes

Sometimes other translations might vary depending on some grammatical trait
of a private message used to create them. Private messages can store this
grammatical information about themselves in [attributes](attributes.html). In
the example below the form of the past tense of _has been updated_ depends on
the grammatical gender of `-brand-name`.

```
-brand-name = Aurora
    .gender = feminine

has-updated =
    { -brand-name.gender ->
        [masculine] { -brand-name} został zaktualizowany.
        [feminine] { -brand-name } została zaktualizowana.
       *[other] Program { -brand-name } został zaktualizowany.
    }
```

Use attributes to describe grammatical traits and properties. Genders,
animacy, whether the private message starts with a vowel or not etc.
Attributes of private messages are also private and may not be retrieved by
the localization runtime. They can only be used as
[selectors](selectors.html).
